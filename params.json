This likely makes no sense when using line charts, but this would work well with the [flot-topbar](https://github.com/jasonroman/flot-topbar) plugin.\r\n\r\nThe plugin does support comparing all other series to a specific series (which skips comparing to itself), however you would still need to modify the colors for each series individually.\r\n\r\nView the <a href=\"http://jasonroman.github.io/flot-compareseries/example.html\">example page</a> to see the plugin in action.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSpecifying for all series:\r\n\r\n    series: {\r\n        compare: {\r\n            enabled:      boolean\r\n            seriesIndex:  int - index of which series to compare to\r\n            colorAbove:   colorspec - color with values greater than/equal to the corresponding comparison series\r\n            colorBelow:   colorspec - color with values less than the corresponding comparison series\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSpecifying for a single series (recommended):\r\n\r\n    $.plot($(\"#placeholder\"), [{\r\n        data: [ ... ],\r\n        compare: { ... }\r\n    }])\r\n\r\nThe following is a break-down of the options:\r\n\r\n* **enabled:** boolean - to enable or disable the comparison for the series (default false)\r\n* **seriesIndex:** integer - the numerical index of which series to compare this series to (index starts at 0, also the default)\r\n* **colorAbove:** colorspec - the color of values that are greater than or equal to the corresponding value in the compared series (default #FF0000)\r\n* **colorBelow:** colorspec - the color of values that are less than the corresponding value in the compared series (default #00FF00)\r\n","google":"UA-48986218-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
